            var win = Ti.UI.createWindow({
                fullscreen:true

                var i=1;
                for (i=1;i<=3;i++) {
                    data.push({properties:{title:'ROW '+(counter+i)}})
                }
                counter += 3;
                return data;
            }
            var section = Ti.UI.createListSection();
            section.setItems(genData());
            var control = Ti.UI.createRefreshControl({

                    section.appendItems(genData());
